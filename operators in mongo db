how to get distinct values of a particular key??
we can use 'distinct ' function in order
db.collectionName.distinct("key");

ab bari ati operators ki such as greather than ,snaller than equal to or many more

mongodb provides different comparison ,logical, bitwise etc operators that we can use very easily
general syntax hoga :- db.collectionName.find({property:{$operator:value}});
sbse pehle not equal to:-db.weather_data.find({type:{$ne :'FM-13'}}).count();

Commonly use operator:
$ne->not equals
$eq->equals
$lt->less than
$lte-> less than or equal to
$gt->greater than
$gte->greater than or equal to
$and->logical and
$or ->logical or
$not logical not
$nor->logical nor
$in->for checking in the array
$nin->not in the array
aur in sbko general syntax ke sath likh do
