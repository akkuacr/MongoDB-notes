How to choose a database?
Nosql m ques nahi phuchte jyada jyada ques mysql m bnte
In order to consider a database for a product we have to consider a database on technical and non-technical criteria

Non - technical criteria

1.Querying Interface:- Every database provide different ways to query the data, for example,SQL in mysql or Pgsql, more
js object-like syntax in mongoDB, KQL in elastic search etc

2.Bulk Processing support:- This refers to how easy it is to import / export data or do processing on multiple records together.

Transaction Support:- Database ki terms set of tasks to acheive something is called transaction . RDBMS supports good transaction


ACID support:-
A-Atomicity -> either the transaction will complete all the steps or ,if something goes sideways then  none of them will be applied
ab real question ye h ki sql transaction acheive kese krta h. (mysql achieve this using undo logs),means isme logs maintain rkhta h aur agr kisi v step ko rollback krna pda toh undo logs se ho jaega

C-Consistency->


I-ISolation -> agr do transaction hori h toh dono independent honi chaiye ,and one shouldn't affect each other
MySql achieves Isolation using locks such as row level locks,or column level locks

D-Durability
